#How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  Math and reading scores by grade
    It creates passing percentages a little bit more competitive with other schools since you are filtering out students that only passed both reading and math.
  Scores by school spending
    For the Budget, specially for Thomas High School we see that is in the lower assigned budget but with on the large size for the school, replacing the numbers average     calculated for 10th to 12th significantly changed the overall performance of the school
  Scores by school size
    Thomas High School is on the larger size school with I high overall passing percentage with the added mean calculations for the rest of the grades
  Scores by school type
    It is clear that the better performing schools tend to be be charter schools
